VCS - Verstion Control System

1. Local VCS :  master is companys DB
Problems : 
1. Same placce
2. if master goes down then all have to wait or maybe rework on the same
3. if systems and master goes down all have to REWORK

Advantage: 
1. People can work at different place

2. if server crashes, all have to rework
3. participants have thier own WORK copy and on server
4. if participants are interested then they can download all the work on their system


3. Distributed VCS : 
1. Project copy is available at their system and servers.
2. if server as well as all individual systems goes down then data is lost.
3.
